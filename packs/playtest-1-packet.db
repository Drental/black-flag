Here, you will find realms like Midgard, Hades, the Dreadful Domains, and homebrew creations tied together by the mysterious will of the maze. These countless worlds rarely reassemble one another on the surface, but all have one unifying truth—heroes shape them.</p><h2>What is [Core Fantasy Roleplaying]?</h2><p>[Core Fantasy Roleplaying] is an action-oriented roleplaying game that pits a group of heroic adventurers against the myriad of dangers found in fantasy worlds. Through collaborative storytelling, one player—called the Game Master (or GM)—and a group of other players—called Player Characters (or PCs)—will explore unique locations and embark upon adventurous quests within them.</p><h2>What is a Roleplaying Game? </h2><p>A roleplaying game (or RPG) is a form of collaborative storytelling, that usually takes place at a table and requires paper and dice to play. Most RPGs have one player who serves as the Game Master ( or GM) and the other players at the table take on the role of player characters (or PCs).</p><h3>Role of the Game Master</h3><p>The GM’s role is to create the game’s framework and keep the story moving. It is up to the GM to describe to the players what the world looks like, introduce obstacles for the PCs to overcome, and portray all the characters who are not PCs. </p><h3>Role of a Player Character</h3><p>A player’s role is to portray their character as fully as possible. Imagine perceiving the world through the character’s senses and reacting as they would to the situations presented by the GM. When interacting with characters portrayed by the GM or other PCs, a player’s voice serves as the character’s.</p><h2>The Dice</h2><p>Most of [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] gameplay happens through conversation and shared imagination. However, dice come into play whenever conflict presents itself or the PCs attempt to do remarkable things outside the scope of normalcy. The mechanics of this system require the use of several different types of polyhedral dice: four-sided ([[/r d4]]), six-sided ([[/r d6]]), eight-sided ([[/r d8]]), ten-sided ([[/r d10]]), twelve-sided ([[/r d12]]), and twenty-sided dice ([[/r d20]]). It is recommended that each player has a set of dice that includes at least one of each type. </p><p>Dice represent the element of chance. A die roll is almost always combined with a creature’s abilities to give a more accurate result of what happens—after all, adventuring is all about a combination of luck and skill. The specific rules concerning dice rolls are described in detail in Chapter 2. </p><p>For now, all you need to know is when you see something like [[/r 2d4 + 2]], you can simply click on the expression to roll it in Foundry VTT or you can roll 2 four-sided (d4) dice, add the results, then add 2 to get your final total. </p><p>Occasionally, you will also need to roll “percentile dice.” To do so, grab two d10s, designate one to represent the tens digit and the other to represent the ones digit. So, if you roll a 5 on the tens-digit die and a 2 on the ones-digit die, your result is 52. If you roll 0 on both dice, your result is 100.</p><h2>Other Tools You Need to Play</h2><p>In addition to this book and a polyhedral dice set, each PC will need a printed or digital character sheet. The GM will need [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] Monster Vault. The [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] Game Master Guide is also helpful. That is all that is strictly necessary for play, but additional resources like physical or virtual grids for creating maps, character tokens, and pencils and paper or digital note-taking platforms are all helpful tools.</p><h2>What's In This Book?</h2><p>This book contains all the basic information you need to play [Core Fantasy Roleplaying].

Your setting might have a unique spin on how magic works, but it should be present somehow, and the PCs should be able to access it.</p><h2>Heroic Adventures</h2><p>Fantasy stories are about heroes. The heroes—in this case, the PCs—need to be the focus of the stories you create with [Core Fantasy Roleplaying]. They need plenty of opportunities to defeat foes, make important decisions, and solve various other problems with their actions.</p><h2>Unique Locations to Explore</h2><p>Fantasy worlds are full of unique locales, cultures, and creatures. [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] games should include all manner of interesting corners to explore and wonders to uncover.</p><h2>Power Structures and Systems</h2><p>Whether through villainous empires or friendly guild factions, fantasy stories always include larger organizations that can challenge or push the heroes to grow their abilities. These power structures often form the cornerstone of large campaigns (games with many subsequent sessions) and the most compelling [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] adventures.</p><h2>Conflict</h2><p>At its heart, the fantasy genre is about standing up against impossible odds and—despite everything—emerging victorious.

Before you take these steps, make sure to have a blank character sheet ready to mark your decisions as you make them.</p><h2>1. Create a Character Concept</h2><p>Before you choose any game options, spend some time thinking about what kind of heroic character you want to play. Do you want to be able to cast magic spells? Do you want to be good at swinging a sword? Do you want to play a human or portray a member of a more fantastical lineage? Having an idea of what you might enjoy playing can help guide many of the decisions you will make in the following steps</p><p>During this brainstorming phase, talk to the other players about your concept and ideas. Hearing what other players have in mind for their characters can help narrow down your options or inspire you to create a concept that works well with other adventurers in your party. For example, if all the other PCs are creating roughand-tumble warriors, it might be a perfect move for you to make a cleric so you can patch them up with healing magic!</p><div class=\"callout informative\"><h5>Don't Know Where to Start?</h5><p>If you are brand new to the game and have no idea where to start creating a heroic character concept, that’s okay! Many of the options available to you are common archetypes found in all manner of fantasy media. Modeling your adventurer after a character from a fantasy film, book, or other source you enjoy is a fantastic first step. And of course, don’t be afraid to rely on the other players at your table for help. Your GM or more experienced players likely have suggestions on what character options are easier for beginning players to master and options that best align with the kind of experience you want to have.</p></div><h2>2. Choose a Class</h2><p>Once you have decided on a character concept, you will likely have a good idea of the types of things you want your character to do during gameplay. Choosing your character’s class is the most important factor in bringing those ideas to life. Every adventurer has a character class that dictates the majority of the mechanical abilities you have access to. It can be helpful to think of a character’s class like their job, with each type covering a different set of skills and responsibilities.</p><p>Your character class gives you class features at 1st level as described in each class features table (see “Character Classes” later in this chapter) and lists other features you gain access to as your character gains adventuring experience and levels up. Your choice of character class also dictates your proficiencies, which is a game term describing what kinds of equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons, or tools) and what kind of challenges you are best equipped to handle (namely skills and saves)</p><p>Choosing your character class can also help you make other decisions in the following steps. For example, each class has a “Build Suggestions” section, that recommends what ability scores (described in Step 3) work best with your class abilities.</p><h3>Level</h3><p>Characters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20th level by gaining experience (XP) during their adventures. By default, PCs start with 0 XP.</p><h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3><p>Your class determines the size of your Hit Dice, which is in turn used to calculate your hit points. Your hit-point total represents your character’s life force. Classes with bigger Hit Dice—like a d10—are more likely to survive a few hits in combat than a class with smaller Hit Dice—like a d6.</p><p>At 1st level your character starts with a hit-point total equal to the highest number on their Hit Dice, plus their CON modifier. So, a 1st-level fighter (d10 Hit Die) with a CON +3 would start with a hit-point total of 13.</p><div class=\"callout informative\"><h5>About Those Dice</h5><p>The [Core Fantasy Roleplaying] system uses polyhedral dice to resolve actions. These dice are abbreviated in game text, so a four-sided die is a d4, a six-sided die is a d6, and so on for d8, d10, d12, and d10. Percentile dice rolls are rolled with two dice and abbreviated d%.</p></div><h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3><p>As your character advances in levels, they become generally better at what they are trained to do—a concept which is represented by the Proficiency Bonus (PB). While the PB advances at the same rate for every class, it is included in each class progression table to make it easier for you to track.</p><p>Whenever you make a d20 check that involves a skill, tool, or save you have Proficiency in, you get to add your PB to that roll. Occasionally, features might allow you to double your PB on particular kinds of rolls, but a PB can only ever be applied once to a particular roll.</p><h2>3. Determine Ability Scores</h2><div class=\"align-right\"><p><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th>Ability Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Character features are tied to six different numbers called ability scores. These scores represent your various physical and mental capabilities. The six scores are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong>, representing your physical might</p></li><li><p><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong>, representing your agility and reaction time</p></li><li><p><strong>Constitution (CON)</strong>, representing your endurance and physical fortitude</p></li><li><p><strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong>, representing your ability to acquire and apply knowledge</p></li><li><p><strong>Wisdom (WIS)</strong>, representing your intuition and mental fortitude</p></li><li><p><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong>, representing your self-confidence and your ability to influence others</p></li></ul><p>To determine your starting ability scores, roll 4d6, add up the highest 3 (discarding the low die) to get your total. Foundry can automate this roll for you by clicking the following formula which automatically keeps the top 3 results: [[/r 4d6kh3]]. Do this five more times until you have six totals between 3 and 18. Assign those six numbers to the ability scores you choose. Add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or below and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below, and you’re done!</p><p>Higher numbers mean better odds for your character with that ability. As you level up, you will have opportunities to increase these scores, but a PC can never have an ability score higher than 20. An average person has 10 in every ability score—so these numbers emphasize how uniquely powerful adventurers are!</p><p>Once your scores are assigned, use the following charts to figure out your ability score modifiers. Your ability modifiers are the most important part of your ability scores and will be used almost exclusively to calculate your character abilities (as opposed to your full ability score).</p><div class=\"callout advice\"><p><strong>Player Advice:</strong> Whenever you see a particular ability score referenced in the rules, assume it means ability score modifier. For example, a feature that reads “. . . roll and add your STR,” means add your Strength ability modifier, not your full Strength ability score.</p></div><h4>Alternate Starting Scores</h4><p>If you don’t want to use the starting scores listed above, there are a couple of alternative methods you can use to determine your scores.</p><div class=\"align-right\"><p><strong>Point-Buy Score Cost</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th>Score</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5>Point-Buy</h5><p>You can assign your starting scores with the point-buy method. Here are the rules to use if you choose to do so:</p><ul><li><p>You start with 32 points to spend on your ability scores.</p></li><li><p>The point-cost of each potential score is shown on the PointBuy Cost table (As an example, a score of 12 costs 4 points).</p></li><li><p>18 is the highest ability score you can start with, and you can’t have a score lower than 8.</p></li></ul><h5>Standard Array</h5><p>You can assign your starting scores with the standard-array method. Here are the rules to use if you choose to do so:</p><p>Assign one of the following numbers to each ability score: 16,15,13,12,10, and 8.</p><p></p><div class=\"callout advice\"><p><strong>Player Advice:</strong> Remember, each character class includes suggestions of the most useful way to assign your ability scores if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your class features.</p></div><h2>4. Choose a Lineage &amp; Heritage</h2><p>Once your class is decided, choose your character’s lineage and heritage from the options in the @UUID[.oWlAR8o5t446Oksi]{Lineage &amp; Heritage} section presented later in this chapter.</p><p>Adventurers can choose to be human or can be one of the @UUID[.Jel935uRgfLpoVmR]{lineages} common to the fantasy genre, like dwarf or elf. A heroic character’s lineage informs certain hereditary traits like average lifespan, size, speed, and any special adaptations like the ability to see in the dark.</p><p>You will also choose your character’s @UUID[.z7QmDJUCtX24wDR9]{heritage}, which informs traits your character has because of their connection to a particular group or society.</p><h2>5. Choose a Background</h2><p>Choose a background from the options presented in the @UUID[.f93KwovIrTi0GAh2]{Backgrounds} section presented later in this chapter. Your choice of background helps define your character’s personal history (also called backstory) prior to taking up the mantle of an adventurer. Backgrounds give you access to skill proficiencies, talents, and other benefits like additional languages.</p><h2>6. Fill in the Blanks</h2><p>At this point, all the game rule decisions for your character should be locked in. Take some time to review and fill in any of the blank sections on your character sheet (see “Final Checklist” below). If you haven’t already, make sure to give your character a name and decide what they look like. It’s also a good idea to think about your character’s history and personality—but it’s perfectly fine to decide these details after a game session or two as you grow more comfortable playing your character.</p><div class=\"callout informative\"><h5>Final Checklist</h5><p>Double check that you have all of the following information on your character sheet.</p><ol style=\"columns:2\"><li><p>Your class and your class features, including:</p><ul><li><p>Note your Hit-Die size</p></li><li><p>If you have spellcasting, mark your available spell slots and spells known (if applicable)</p></li><li><p>Any skills you are proficient in</p></li><li><p>Any equipment and tools you are proficient with</p></li><li><p>Saves you are proficient with</p></li><li><p>Your Proficiency Bonus</p></li><li><p>Your starting equipment</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your ability scores are assigned, and you have used them to calculate the following:</p><ul><li><p>Your hit-point total</p></li><li><p>Your spell save DC and your spellcasting attack modifier (if applicable)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your lineage and heritage, including:</p><ul><li><p>Your size</p></li><li><p>Your senses</p></li><li><p>Your base movement speed (or speeds, if applicable)</p></li><li><p>Any additional proficiencies</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your background, including:</p><ul><li><p>Any skill or tool proficiencies</p></li><li><p>Your languages</p></li><li><p>Your talent</p></li><li><p>Any additional starting equipment</p></li><li><p>Your adventuring motivation</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your Luck points are set to 0</p></li><li><p>Your name and basic descriptive information like height, hair color, and eye color</p></li><li><p>You’re now ready to play!</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Gaining Levels","type":"text","_id":"67FR0z8b2DXQQYV8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Characters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20th level by gaining experience (XP) during their adventures.

The GM decides which method they want to use.</p><h3>Tracking XP</h3><p>The first method for leveling characters is tracking Experience Points (XP). The Level Advancement table details the amount of XP you need to advance to new levels.</p><p><strong>Level Advancement</strong></p><h3>Tracking Milestones</h3><p>The second method for leveling characters is tracking milestones. When using milestones, players do not receive individual XP amounts. Instead, they level up upon achieving certain narrative goals established by the GM. The milestone method is ideal for faster paced games or player groups that are focused on storytelling (as opposed to tactical combat or dungeon delving).</p><p>As a general rule, 1st-level PCs should hit level-up milestones after a single game session, 2nd level PCs should hit level-up milestones after two game sessions, 3rd level PCs should hit level-up milestones after three game sessions, and approximately every three sessions thereafter. A GM may speed up or slow down milestone advancement at their discretion, as suits their game.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Lineage & Heritage","type":"text","_id":"oWlAR8o5t446Oksi","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>While humans are common to most settings, the fantasy genre is full of other fantastical kinds of people. When you create your character, you can choose whether your hereditary traits are human or one of these other fantasy lineages. You will also use this section to determine if you have heritage traits tied to your lineage or to an entirely different kind of society.</p><h2>Elements of a Lineage</h2><p>Your lineage dictates certain fantastical lineage traits your character has because of their ancestry. The following sections are included among the traits of each lineage option.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the lineage grows into adulthood, as well as expected lifespan. You can choose any starting age for your adventurer, but if you want to play a very young or very old character, make sure to run it by your GM.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Characters of most lineages are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few lineages are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall) or can choose to be Small, which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).</p><h2>Elements of a Heritage</h2><p>Your heritage dictates certain abilities you have because of your connection to a particular group or society. Heritage includes all manner of tangible and intangible cultural elements such as architecture, works of art, folklore, traditions, language, and natural environment.</p><p>While it is impossible to represent all the different types of heritage present in the fantasy genre, each lineage includes example heritages common to the fantasy lineages presented here. Choose one of the heritages detailed in your character’s lineage or choose one of the heritages detailed in a different lineage if that better fits the narrative of your character.</p><p>Each lineage includes heritage options that are most common to members of that lineage, so if you want to play a typical dwarf, you’ll likely want to select one of the heritage options listed in the dwarf section. However, you can choose any heritage you wish from any section, regardless of your choice of lineage. This flexibility is helpful if you want to play a character with unique origins. For example, if your character has one human parent and one elven parent, you could choose the human lineage option to represent your dominant hereditary traits, but one of the elven heritage options to represent being raised in an elven society.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Part of deciding your character’s traits is selecting an alignment, which broadly describes your character’s moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). By default, you choose your own alignment—with the approval of your GM. Alternatively, you can select one of the suggested alignments given in your chosen heritage.</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>Your choice of heritage dictates how many languages you know. By default, all characters know the Common language and one other language of your choice, but some heritages allow you to choose additional languages. If you are unsure which language to choose, consult the suggested languages provided in each Heritage option.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Backgrounds","type":"text","_id":"f93KwovIrTi0GAh2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Your choice of background helps define your character’s personal history (also called backstory) prior to taking up the mantle of an adventurer.

To customize a background, you can replace one Talent list with any other, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coins on gear as described in the Equipment section.
